what to do with database:
copy the code lines to mysql

- drop cascade goal_reached:
drop table goal_reached cascade;

- drop table goal, game
drop table goal;
drop table game;

- create table game and add example user(users can use this existing player credentials or create new during game):
CREATE TABLE game (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(40),
    password VARCHAR(40),
    money INT,
    fuel INT,
    people_saved INT,
    municipality_visited INT,
    fuel_efficiency FLOAT,
    location INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (location) REFERENCES airport (ident)
);

INSERT INTO game (username, password, money, fuel, people_saved, municipality_visited, fuel_efficiency, location)
VALUES ('username', 'password', 3000, 5000, 0, 0, 0.8, "EFHK");

- add to table airport(people int random 10-50, fuel_price int random 8-12, probability int random 1-20)
ALTER TABLE airport
ADD COLUMN people INT;
ALTER TABLE airport
ADD COLUMN fuel_price INT;
ALTER TABLE airport
ADD COLUMN probability INT;
UPDATE airport
SET people = FLOOR(10 + RAND() * 41);
UPDATE airport
SET fuel_price = FLOOR(8 + RAND() * 5);
UPDATE airport
SET probability = FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 20);

- delete rows in airport where airport name is like "%Unknown%":
DELETE FROM airport
WHERE name LIKE '%Unknown%';

- delete airports with same name but keep 1 left:
delete a1 from airport a1 join (select name, min(id) as min_id from airport group by name having count(*) > 1) a2 on a1.name = a2.name where a1.id <> a2.min_id;

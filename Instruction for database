what to do with database:
- drop cascade goal_reached
- drop table goal, game
- create table game(id primary key int not null auto increment, username varchar40, password varchar40, money int 5000, fuel int 1000, people_saved int 0, municipality_visited int 0, fuel_efficiency float 0.8, location foreign key references to airport.ident EFHK)
- add to table airport(people int random 10-50, fuel_price int random 8-12, probability int random 1-20)
- delete rows in airport where airport name is like "%Unknown%"
- delete airports with same name but keep 1 left:
delete a1 from airport a1 join (select name, min(id) as min_id from airport group by name having count(*) > 1) a2 on a1.name = a2.name where a1.id <> a2.min_id;
